   abstract = {The Benjamini–Hochberg method controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR) using sequential modified Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing. While the Bonferroni correction relies on the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER), Benjamini and Hochberg introduced the idea of a FDR to control for multiple hypotheses testing. In the statistical context, discovery refers to the rejection of a hypothesis. Therefore, a false discovery is an incorrect rejection of a hypothesis and the FDR is the likelihood such a rejection occurs. Controlling the FDR instead of the FWER is less stringent and increases the method’s power. As a result, more hypotheses may be rejected and more discoveries may be made. In the Benjamini–Hochberg method, hypotheses are first ordered and then rejected or accepted based on their p-values. A p-value is a data point for each hypothesis describing the likelihood of an observation based on a probability distribution. The Benjamini–Hochberg method begins by...},

   abstract = {Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and has previously been associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders affecting multiple organ systems. The high prevalence of autoimmune disease, in conjunction with other inflammatory and infectious diseases, in this population suggests an intrinsic immune dysregulation associated with triplication of chromosome 21. Emerging data on the role of chromosome 21 in interferon activation, cytokine production, and activation of B-cell mediated autoimmunity are emerging hypotheses that may explain the elevated prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease, celiac disease, type I diabetes, autoimmune skin disease, and a variety of autoimmune neurologic conditions. As the life expectancy for individuals with Down syndrome increases, knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical features, management and underlying causes of these conditions will become increasingly important. Disorders such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are prevalent in between 13 and 34% of individuals with Down syndrome but only 3% of the neurotypical population, a pattern similarly recognized in individuals with Celiac Disease (5.8% v 0.5–2%), alopecia areata (27.7% v. 2%), and vitiligo (4.4% v. 0.05–1.55%), respectively. Given the chronicity of autoimmune conditions, early identification and management can significantly impact the quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome. This comprehensive review will highlight common clinical autoimmune conditions observed in individuals with Down syndrome and explore our current understanding of the mechanisms of disease in this population.},

   abstract = {Within immune system-related diseases, autoimmunity has always represented a field of great interest, although many aspects remain poorly understood even today. Genetic syndromes associated with immunity disorders are common and represent an interesting model for a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of autoimmunity predisposition. Among these conditions, Down syndrome (DS) certainly deserves special attention as it represents the most common genetic syndrome associated with immune dysregulation, involving both innate and adaptive immunity. Autoimmunity represents a well-known complication of DS: it is estimated that people affected by this disease present a risk four to six times higher than the normal population to develop autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Several factors have been considered as possible etiology, including genetic and epigenetic modifications and immune dysregulation. In times in which the life expectancy of people with DS has been extremely prolonged, thanks to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease and infectious complications, knowledge of the mechanisms and proper management of autoimmune diseases within this syndrome has become essential. In this short review, we aim to report the current literature regarding the genetic, immune, and environmental factors that have been proposed as the possible underlying mechanism of autoimmunity in individuals with DS, with the intent to provide insight for a comprehensive understanding of these diseases in genetic syndromes.},

@article{MHC,
   abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one of the most extensively studied regions in the human genome because of the association of variants at this locus with autoimmune, infectious, and inflammatory diseases. However, identification of causal variants within the MHC for the majority of these diseases has remained difficult due to the great variability and extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) that exists among alleles throughout this locus, coupled with inadequate study design whereby only a limited subset of about 20 from a total of approximately 250 genes have been studied in small cohorts of predominantly European origin. We have performed a review and pooled analysis of the past 30 years of research on the role of the MHC in six genetically complex disease traits - multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) - in order to consolidate and evaluate the current literature regarding MHC genetics in these common autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We corroborate established MHC disease associations and identify predisposing variants that previously have not been appreciated. Furthermore, we find a number of interesting commonalities and differences across diseases that implicate both general and disease-specific pathogenetic mechanisms in autoimmunity. © 2008 Fernando et al.},

This domain is essential for the recruitment of a number of signaling components upon activation by either agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies or cognate CD95 ligand that initiate apoptosis. The complex of proteins that forms upon triggering of CD95 is called the death-inducting signaling complex (DISC). The DISC consists of an adaptor protein and initiator caspases and is essential for induction of apoptosis. A number of proteins have been reported to regulate formation or activity of the DISC.

Upregulation of p53 and APO-1/Fas (CD95) precedes apoptosis in many cell types, and a potential role for these molecules has already been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several other neurodegenerative diseases. We measured p53 and APO-1/Fas (CD95) protein in four different regions of cerebral cortex and cerebellum in nine adult DS patients with Alzheimer-like neuropathologic lesions compared to nine controls. Quantitative ELISA demonstrated higher frontal lobe (mean ± SD: 0.10 ± 0.035 vs. 0.041 ± 0.016 ng/mg protein), temporal lobe (0.062 ± 0.021 vs. 0.032 ± 0.019 ng/mg protein) and cerebellar levels (0.078 ± 0:030 vs. 0.039 ± 0.032 ng/mg protein) of p53 protein, and higher temporal lobe (mean ± SD: 12.3 ± 4.3 vs. 5.3 ± 2.0 U/mg protein) and cerebellar levels (5.9 ± 1.4 vs. 2.9 ±1.1 U/mg protein) of APO-1/Fas (CD95) protein. The results suggest that p53- or APO-1/Fas (CD95)-associated apoptosis may be an important feature of neurodegeneration in DS.},

   abstract = {Selective vulnerability of neuronal populations occurs in both Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in disproportional degeneration of pyramidal neurons (PNs) affecting memory and executive function. Elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of these populations will provide pivotal insights for disease progression in DS and AD. Single population RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on neurons critical for executive function, prefrontal cortex Brodmann area 9 (BA9) layer III (L3) and layer V (L5) excitatory PNs in postmortem human DS and age- and sex-matched control (CTR) brains. Data mining was performed on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from PNs in each lamina with DEGs divergent between lamina identified and interrogated. Bioinformatic inquiry of L3 PNs revealed more unique/differentially expressed DEGs (uDEGs) than in L5 PNs in DS compared to CTR subjects, indicating gene dysregulation shows both spatial and cortical laminar projection neuron dependent dysregulation. DS triplicated human chromosome 21 (HSA21) comprised a subset of DEGs only dysregulated in L3 or L5 neurons, demonstrating partial cellular specificity in HSA21 expression. These HSA21 uDEGs had a disproportionally high number of noncoding RNAs, suggesting lamina specific dysfunctional gene regulation. L3 uDEGs revealed overall more dysregulation of cellular pathways and processes, many relevant to early AD pathogenesis, while L5 revealed processes suggestive of frank AD pathology. These findings indicate that trisomy differentially affects a subpopulation of uDEGs in L3 and L5 BA9 projection neurons in aged individuals with DS, which may inform circuit specific pathogenesis underlying DS and AD.},

   abstract = {We elucidated the molecular fingerprint of vulnerable excitatory neurons within select cortical lamina of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) for mechanistic understanding and therapeutic potential that also informs Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology. Frontal cortex (BA9) layer III (L3) and layer V (L5) pyramidal neurons were microisolated from postmortem human DS and age- and sex-matched controls (CTR) to interrogate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and key biological pathways relevant to neurodegenerative programs. We identified > 2300 DEGs exhibiting convergent dysregulation of gene expression in both L3 and L5 pyramidal neurons in individuals with DS versus CTR subjects. DEGs included over 100 triplicated human chromosome 21 genes in L3 and L5 neurons, demonstrating a trisomic neuronal karyotype in both laminae. In addition, thousands of other DEGs were identified, indicating gene dysregulation is not limited to trisomic genes in the aged DS brain, which we postulate is relevant to AD pathobiology. Convergent L3 and L5 DEGs highlighted pertinent biological pathways and identified key pathway-associated targets likely underlying corticocortical neurodegeneration and related cognitive decline in individuals with DS. Select key DEGs were interrogated as potential hub genes driving dysregulation, namely the triplicated DEGs amyloid precursor protein (APP) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), along with key signaling DEGs including mitogen activated protein kinase 1 and 3 (MAPK1, MAPK3) and calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2A), among others. Hub DEGs determined from multiple pathway analyses identified potential therapeutic candidates for amelioration of cortical neuron dysfunction and cognitive decline in DS with translational relevance to AD.},

   abstract = {Pathway enrichment analysis helps researchers gain mechanistic insight into gene lists generated from genome-scale (omics) experiments. This method identifies biological pathways that are enriched in a gene list more than would be expected by chance. We explain the procedures of pathway enrichment analysis and present a practical step-by-step guide to help interpret gene lists resulting from RNA-seq and genome-sequencing experiments. The protocol comprises three major steps: definition of a gene list from omics data, determination of statistically enriched pathways, and visualization and interpretation of the results. We describe how to use this protocol with published examples of differentially expressed genes and mutated cancer genes; however, the principles can be applied to diverse types of omics data. The protocol describes innovative visualization techniques, provides comprehensive background and troubleshooting guidelines, and uses freely available and frequently updated software, including g:Profiler, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Cytoscape and EnrichmentMap. The complete protocol can be performed in ~4.5 h and is designed for use by biologists with no prior bioinformatics training.},
