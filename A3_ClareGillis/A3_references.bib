   abstract = {Down syndrome is a well-studied aneuploidy condition in humans, which is associated with various disease phenotypes including cardiovascular, neurological, haematological and immunological disease processes. This review paper aims to discuss the research conducted on gene expression studies during fetal development. A descriptive review was conducted, encompassing all papers published on the PubMed database between September 1960 and September 2022. We found that in amniotic fluid, certain genes such as COL6A1 and DSCR1 were found to be affected, resulting in phenotypical craniofacial changes. Additionally, other genes such as GSTT1, CLIC6, ITGB2, C21orf67, C21orf86 and RUNX1 were also identified to be affected in the amniotic fluid. In the placenta, dysregulation of genes like MEST, SNF1LK and LOX was observed, which in turn affected nervous system development. In the brain, dysregulation of genes DYRK1A, DNMT3L, DNMT3B, TBX1, olig2 and AQP4 has been shown to contribute to intellectual disability. In the cardiac tissues, dysregulated expression of genes GART, ETS2 and ERG was found to cause abnormalities. Furthermore, dysregulation of XIST, RUNX1, SON, ERG and STAT1 was observed, contributing to myeloproliferative disorders. Understanding the differential expression of genes provides insights into the genetic consequences of DS. A better understanding of these processes could potentially pave the way for the development of genetic and pharmacological therapies.},

   abstract = {Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genomic disorder characterized by the increased incidence of developing early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In DS, the triplication of genes on chromosome 21 is intimately associated with the increase of AD pathological hallmarks and with the development of brain redox imbalance and aberrant proteostasis. Increasing evidence has recently shown that oxidative stress (OS), associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and with the failure of antioxidant responses (e.g., SOD1 and Nrf2), is an early signature of DS, promoting protein oxidation and the formation of toxic protein aggregates. In turn, systems involved in the surveillance of protein synthesis/folding/degradation mechanisms, such as the integrated stress response (ISR), the unfolded stress response (UPR), and autophagy, are impaired in DS, thus exacerbating brain damage. A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have been applied to the context of DS with the aim of rescuing redox balance and proteostasis by boosting the antioxidant response and/or inducing the mechanisms of protein re-folding and clearance, and at final of reducing cognitive decline. So far, such therapeutic approaches demonstrated their efficacy in reverting several aspects of DS phenotype in murine models, however, additional studies aimed to translate these approaches in clinical practice are still needed.},

   abstract = {Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent chromosomal disorder. It is caused by the triplication of human chromosome 21, leading to increased dosage of a variety of genes including APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein). Mainly for this reason, individuals with DS are at high risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extensive literature identified various morphological and molecular abnormalities in the endo-lysosomal pathway both in DS and AD. Most studies in this field investigated the causative role of APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) in endo-lysosomal dysfunctions, thus linking phenotypes observed in DS and AD. In DS context, several lines of evidence and emerging hypotheses suggest that other molecular players and pathways may be implicated in these complex phenotypes. In this review, we outline the normal functioning of endosomal trafficking and summarize the research on endo-lysosomal dysfunction in DS in light of AD findings. We emphasize the role of genes of chromosome 21 implicated in endocytosis to explain endosomal abnormalities and set the limitations and perspectives of models used to explore endo-lysosomal dysfunction in DS and find new biomarkers. The review highlights the complexity of endo-lysosomal dysfunction in DS and suggests directions for future research in the field.},

   abstract = {Intracellular protein trafficking via the endosomes plays a key role in the maintenance of normal neuronal function. Although many diseases of the central nervous system exhibit specific pathological hallmarks, abnormalities of the endosome system are common traits for several of them, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Three main routes originate from the endosomes: the recycling, degradation, and retrograde pathways. Studies have shown that the majority of Down syndrome subjects develop AD pathology and manifest altered morphology and number of endosomes, and abnormalities in lysosome acidification and exosome secretion, suggesting that dysfunction of one of these pathways could play a functional role in the AD-like phenotype of the syndrome. Two of the major endosomal routes are mediated by the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network or to the cell membrane. Recently, a new endosome system structurally related to the retromer, called “retriever,” has been reported. Whereas we know a great deal about the neuropathophysiology of the retromer complex, no precise pathogenic role for the retriever has yet been identified. Here, we will review the neurobiology of the endosome system and its role as key player in the development of AD-like pathology in Down syndrome. Additionally, we will discuss current knowledge on these two main endosome systems, retromer and retriever, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:4–14.},

Both of them reflect molecular evolution of human starting from the beginning of life (about 4.5 billion years ago) until the origin of Homo sapiens species about 100000 years ago. From this reason human genome contains some features that are common for different groups of organisms and some features that are unique for Homo sapiens. 3.2 × 109 base pairs of human nuclear genome are packed into 23 chromosomes of different size. The smallest chromosome - 21st contains 5 × 107 base pairs while the biggest one -1st contains 2.63 × 108 base pairs. Despite the fact that the nucleotide sequence of all chromosomes is established, the organisation of nuclear genome put still questions: for example: the exact number of genes encoded by the human genome is still unknown giving estimations from 30 to 150 thousand genes. Coding sequences represent a few percent of human nuclear genome. The majority of the genome is represented by repetitive sequences (about 50%) and noncoding unique sequences. This part of the genome is frequently wrongly called "junk DNA". The distribution of genes on chromosomes is irregular, DNA fragments containing low percentage of GC pairs code lower number of genes than the fragments of high percentage of GC pairs.},

   abstract = {Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and has previously been associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders affecting multiple organ systems. The high prevalence of autoimmune disease, in conjunction with other inflammatory and infectious diseases, in this population suggests an intrinsic immune dysregulation associated with triplication of chromosome 21. Emerging data on the role of chromosome 21 in interferon activation, cytokine production, and activation of B-cell mediated autoimmunity are emerging hypotheses that may explain the elevated prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease, celiac disease, type I diabetes, autoimmune skin disease, and a variety of autoimmune neurologic conditions. As the life expectancy for individuals with Down syndrome increases, knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical features, management and underlying causes of these conditions will become increasingly important. Disorders such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are prevalent in between 13 and 34% of individuals with Down syndrome but only 3% of the neurotypical population, a pattern similarly recognized in individuals with Celiac Disease (5.8% v 0.5–2%), alopecia areata (27.7% v. 2%), and vitiligo (4.4% v. 0.05–1.55%), respectively. Given the chronicity of autoimmune conditions, early identification and management can significantly impact the quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome. This comprehensive review will highlight common clinical autoimmune conditions observed in individuals with Down syndrome and explore our current understanding of the mechanisms of disease in this population.},

   abstract = {Within immune system-related diseases, autoimmunity has always represented a field of great interest, although many aspects remain poorly understood even today. Genetic syndromes associated with immunity disorders are common and represent an interesting model for a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of autoimmunity predisposition. Among these conditions, Down syndrome (DS) certainly deserves special attention as it represents the most common genetic syndrome associated with immune dysregulation, involving both innate and adaptive immunity. Autoimmunity represents a well-known complication of DS: it is estimated that people affected by this disease present a risk four to six times higher than the normal population to develop autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Several factors have been considered as possible etiology, including genetic and epigenetic modifications and immune dysregulation. In times in which the life expectancy of people with DS has been extremely prolonged, thanks to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease and infectious complications, knowledge of the mechanisms and proper management of autoimmune diseases within this syndrome has become essential. In this short review, we aim to report the current literature regarding the genetic, immune, and environmental factors that have been proposed as the possible underlying mechanism of autoimmunity in individuals with DS, with the intent to provide insight for a comprehensive understanding of these diseases in genetic syndromes.},

The complex of proteins that forms upon triggering of CD95 is called the death-inducting signaling complex (DISC). The DISC consists of an adaptor protein and initiator caspases and is essential for induction of apoptosis. A number of proteins have been reported to regulate formation or activity of the DISC.

We measured p53 and APO-1/Fas (CD95) protein in four different regions of cerebral cortex and cerebellum in nine adult DS patients with Alzheimer-like neuropathologic lesions compared to nine controls. Quantitative ELISA demonstrated higher frontal lobe (mean ± SD: 0.10 ± 0.035 vs. 0.041 ± 0.016 ng/mg protein), temporal lobe (0.062 ± 0.021 vs. 0.032 ± 0.019 ng/mg protein) and cerebellar levels (0.078 ± 0:030 vs. 0.039 ± 0.032 ng/mg protein) of p53 protein, and higher temporal lobe (mean ± SD: 12.3 ± 4.3 vs. 5.3 ± 2.0 U/mg protein) and cerebellar levels (5.9 ± 1.4 vs. 2.9 ±1.1 U/mg protein) of APO-1/Fas (CD95) protein.

Elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of these populations will provide pivotal insights for disease progression in DS and AD. Single population RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on neurons critical for executive function, prefrontal cortex Brodmann area 9 (BA9) layer III (L3) and layer V (L5) excitatory PNs in postmortem human DS and age- and sex-matched control (CTR) brains. Data mining was performed on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from PNs in each lamina with DEGs divergent between lamina identified and interrogated. Bioinformatic inquiry of L3 PNs revealed more unique/differentially expressed DEGs (uDEGs) than in L5 PNs in DS compared to CTR subjects, indicating gene dysregulation shows both spatial and cortical laminar projection neuron dependent dysregulation. DS triplicated human chromosome 21 (HSA21) comprised a subset of DEGs only dysregulated in L3 or L5 neurons, demonstrating partial cellular specificity in HSA21 expression. These HSA21 uDEGs had a disproportionally high number of noncoding RNAs, suggesting lamina specific dysfunctional gene regulation. L3 uDEGs revealed overall more dysregulation of cellular pathways and processes, many relevant to early AD pathogenesis, while L5 revealed processes suggestive of frank AD pathology. These findings indicate that trisomy differentially affects a subpopulation of uDEGs in L3 and L5 BA9 projection neurons in aged individuals with DS, which may inform circuit specific pathogenesis underlying DS and AD.},

We identified > 2300 DEGs exhibiting convergent dysregulation of gene expression in both L3 and L5 pyramidal neurons in individuals with DS versus CTR subjects. DEGs included over 100 triplicated human chromosome 21 genes in L3 and L5 neurons, demonstrating a trisomic neuronal karyotype in both laminae. In addition, thousands of other DEGs were identified, indicating gene dysregulation is not limited to trisomic genes in the aged DS brain, which we postulate is relevant to AD pathobiology. Convergent L3 and L5 DEGs highlighted pertinent biological pathways and identified key pathway-associated targets likely underlying corticocortical neurodegeneration and related cognitive decline in individuals with DS. Select key DEGs were interrogated as potential hub genes driving dysregulation, namely the triplicated DEGs amyloid precursor protein (APP) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), along with key signaling DEGs including mitogen activated protein kinase 1 and 3 (MAPK1, MAPK3) and calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2A), among others.
