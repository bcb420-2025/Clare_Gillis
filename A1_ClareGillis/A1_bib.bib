   abstract = {Selective vulnerability of neuronal populations occurs in both Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in disproportional degeneration of pyramidal neurons (PNs) affecting memory and executive function. Elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of these populations will provide pivotal insights for disease progression in DS and AD. Single population RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on neurons critical for executive function, prefrontal cortex Brodmann area 9 (BA9) layer III (L3) and layer V (L5) excitatory PNs in postmortem human DS and age- and sex-matched control (CTR) brains. Data mining was performed on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from PNs in each lamina with DEGs divergent between lamina identified and interrogated. Bioinformatic inquiry of L3 PNs revealed more unique/differentially expressed DEGs (uDEGs) than in L5 PNs in DS compared to CTR subjects, indicating gene dysregulation shows both spatial and cortical laminar projection neuron dependent dysregulation. DS triplicated human chromosome 21 (HSA21) comprised a subset of DEGs only dysregulated in L3 or L5 neurons, demonstrating partial cellular specificity in HSA21 expression. These HSA21 uDEGs had a disproportionally high number of noncoding RNAs, suggesting lamina specific dysfunctional gene regulation. L3 uDEGs revealed overall more dysregulation of cellular pathways and processes, many relevant to early AD pathogenesis, while L5 revealed processes suggestive of frank AD pathology. These findings indicate that trisomy differentially affects a subpopulation of uDEGs in L3 and L5 BA9 projection neurons in aged individuals with DS, which may inform circuit specific pathogenesis underlying DS and AD.},
